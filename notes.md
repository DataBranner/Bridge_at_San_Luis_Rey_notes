## Notes on Thornton Wilder, _Bridge at San Luis Rey_

I enjoyed the book, which I had never read before. My chief impression while reading was that the five people who died in the accident were, in a Catholic context, in a state of sin because they had not confessed and been absolved by a priest.

The name of the last chapter, "Perhaps an Intention," tells us that the point of the book is to understand God's hand in the accident.

A cheerful priest — one who has learned "a resignation that he did not permit his reason to examine" — tries to rationalize the event and quantify the moral worth of each person. The Church doesn't sanction his explanation and the Inquisition burns him to death.

In the end, a disillusioned nun explains that "the only meaning" of the events of life is whatever love for a person survives that person's death, however briefly.

And maybe that is the symbolism of the bridge, itself.

### Glosses

 * p. 6:. **Mud church of St. Louis**: that is, 13th century French King Louis IX, under whom the greatest Gothic cathedrals were erected. He was canonized not long after his death. This is what the name San Luis Rey refers: "St. Louis the King." This particular cathedral, however, is made of mud.

 * p. 7: **Osier**: kind of willow whose shoots are used in basket-weaving.

 * p. 7: **Limeans**: This book is the first example the OED cites of the word Limean. Limenian is an older form in English, and closer to Spanish _limeño_; the _-ñ-_ is not part of the stem but has morphological meaning ('person from…'; _new yorkeño_ 'New Yorker').

 * p. 7: **Moment of miracle**: transubstantiation of blood and wine during the Eucharist.

 * p. 15: **Spanish court**: by then located in Madrid. The King would have been Philip V of the French House of Bourbon.

 * p. 20: **Perichole**: this is a French form, _la Périchole_; the original Micaela Villegas was known in Spanish as "La Perricholi." She lived about a century later than the character in the book: 1748–1819. The French form of her name was made famous by an Offenbach opera (1868).

 * p. 22: **Chicha**: ale of maize or other ingredients.

 * p. 24: **Mercer**: dealer in fabrics; haberdasher.

 * p. 27: **Vatinian**: intense (said of hatred). After Latin _odium Vatinianum_ 'Vatinian hatred'; from Catullus xiv. 3, addressing Publius Vatinius:

   > odio enim tui, in quo etsi omnis propter tuum in me scelus superare debeo, tamen ab omnibus paene vincor, sic sum incitatus ut, cum te non minus contemnerem quam odissem, tamen vexatum potius quam despectum vellem dimittere.

   > 
   > [For from detestation of you, in which, although, on account of your wicked conduct to me, I ought to go beyond all men, yet I am in fact surpassed by everybody, I was carried away so far, that though I did not despise you at all less than I detest you, still I chose to dismiss you in embarrassment and distress, rather than in contempt.]

   (C. D. Yonge, tr. http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Cic..%20Vat.; accessed 20171224.)

 * p. 79: **Savor**: made savory, given flavor. "savored by a few untidy love-affairs". 

 * p. 92: **Sapphire**: not the first dawn, but blue sky. "The first faint streak of sapphire was appearing behind the peaks." Gerard Manley Hopkins, "The Blessed Virgin Compared To The Air We Breathe": 

   >    Again, look overhead
   >
   > How air is azurèd;
   >
   > O how! nay do but stand
   >
   > Where you can lift your hand
   >
   > Skywards: rich, rich it laps
   >
   > Round the four fingergaps.
   > 
   >    
   >
   > Yet such a sapphire-shot,
   >
   > Charged, steepèd sky will not
   >
   > Stain light.
   >
   >    Yea, mark you this:
   >
   > It does no prejudice.
   > 
   >    
   > 
   > The glass-blue days are those
   >
   > When every colour glows,
   >
   > Each shape and shadow shows.

 * p. 100: **Compact of**: made up of, composed of. "absent-minded, but compact of goodness". 

 * p. 102: **Mantilla**: large veil or scarf covering a woman's head and shoulders. "the sea of mantillas".

### Questions

 * p. 6: "Usurers harangued their wives angrily, in defense of usury." Does this mean that the wives had guilty second thoughts about their husbands' trade?

 * p. 7: Juniper: "this little red-haired Franciscan from Northern Italy." I don't think Ginepro is a common Italian name. What are the associations of juniper? Is the name supposed to sound naïve, befitting a Franciscan? (Franciscan teaching plays down human sin and emphasizes joy and empathy for the poor.) One traditional association of juniper is that its wood burns for a long time. Psalm 120:2-4 (KJV):

   > Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips, and from a deceitful tongue. 
   >
   > What shall be given unto thee? or what shall be done unto thee, thou false tongue? 
   >
   > Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper.

   Does the name, and Juniper's red hair, prefigure his _auto-da-fé_?

 * p. 18: The author speaks in first person; who or what is the author? Also, the author is aware he is not writing in Spanish, because he speaks of translating the Marquesa's letters.

 * p. 79: "broken by the table, the alcove, a grandeeship and ten years of exile". "The table" means meals; what is "the alcove"? Strong drink? "From the table he had received the gout; from the alcove a tendency to convulsions."

 * p. 84: "a delicate and languid magdelinism." Does that mean the air of a fallen woman reformed? Not in OED. Related to _magdalene_ 'reformed prostitute'?
